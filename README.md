# Page-Rank-MPI
Google Page Rank Algorithm in MPI
* The Google Page Rank algorithm has been implemented in a cluster of processors using MPI. The parallel implementation has been compared with a sequential version of the algorithm and significant speed-up has been achieved.
* This was done as an assignment for DS 295: Parallel Programming in Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science.
